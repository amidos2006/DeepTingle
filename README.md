A Deep NN used to generate stories which will tingle your butt. To test the system visit http://www.deeptingle.net.

This repo contains all the code required to train DeepTingle or a similar system.
This repo consists of the following:
- **GloveData:** contains the trained GloVe word embedding over all chuck tingle stories using different sizes (50, 100, 200, 300)
- **Stories:** contains all chuck tingle stories in text files instead of PDFs.
- **website:** contains the files for the website.
- **DeepTingle Alphabet.ipynb:** is a python notebook used to train and test the alphabet based neural network model.
- **DeepTingle Words.ipynb:** is a python notebook used to train and test the word based neural network model.
- **Download Data and Unzip it.ipynb:** is a python notebook helper file to transfer files from GitHub and other sources to our computational machines.
- **From Glove to Words.ipynb:** is a python notebook experiment to train a simple neural network to reverse the GloVe embedding.
- **Preprocessing.ipynb:** is a python notebook used in preprocessing all chuck tingle files to be easier in training.
- **Testing & Experimenting.ipynb:** is a python notebook used in testing different ideas before adding it to the main code.

The core file is **DeepTingle Words.ipynb**. This code is used to train the current neural network used in the website. It contains all the different experiments used in the published paper.
